ADL (Algebraic Data Language)
================================

A framework for building cross language data models. It consists of a DSL for describing data types,
code generators for several target languages, and runtimes for these languages.

The [documentation](doc/introduction.md) contains details on the ADL language itself and the code generation backends.
